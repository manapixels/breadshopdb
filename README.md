# breadshopdb
National Taiwan University Database course project

This is a project that my group and I did in National Taiwan University as part of our Medical Database Systems course. Our objective was to utilise MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJs, NodeJs) to make a web application. In this project, we implemented an inventory system for the administrator to ADD, EDIT, DELETE bread records in a breadshop. There's also an alternative view for customers to view the list of bread in a shopping site-like display.
